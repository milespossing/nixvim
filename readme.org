* Flakes

  So it seems like it might be wise for me to actually introduce my nvim configuration as a standalone nix flake. This is nice for 2 reasons

  - I can put the flake out separate from the rest of my nix configuration, which is nice
  - I can run the nix flake directly without installing it--giving me the ability to test locally.
